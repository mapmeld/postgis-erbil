# Step 3

Do you know SQL?

Before continuing in the tutorial, I want to cover what we know about SQL. Depending
on skill level, this could be a participatory conversation on what queries we can
do, or it can be an introduction to SQL as a whole.

### Learning SQL

### SQL from NodeJS

If you're coding in NodeJS, you can use the regular ```pg``` module, or use my module which verifies it's read-only access ```npm install read-only-pg```

### SQL from Python

If you're coding in Python, use psycopg2 or SQLAlchemy to connect to a database: ```pip install psycopg2```

### Interactive Tutorial

Connect to the database (```psql jserb -U js```) and review SQL concepts:

```sql
SELECT start FROM trains;

SELECT * FROM trains;

SELECT * FROM trains LIMIT 1;

SELECT start, finish, seats FROM trains;

SELECT start, finish, seats
      FROM trains
      WHERE seats = 100;

SELECT CONCAT(CONCAT(start, ' to '), finish) AS route,
        price
      FROM trains
      WHERE seats < 100;


SELECT CONCAT(CONCAT(start, ' to '), finish) AS route,
        price
      FROM trains
      WHERE seats > 50
      AND price > 10;

SELECT COUNT(*) ...

SELECT start, COUNT(*) FROM trains GROUP BY start;

SELECT start, finish, AVG(stars) FROM trains
    JOIN train_reviews ON trains.id = train_reviews.train_id
    GROUP BY start, finish;
```

Some newer databases are known as 'NoSQL' databases because they allow other types
of data storage. For example, MongoDB will store many nested objects and arrays in one JSON 'document'. You can write special queries to go deep into these unstructured
individualized objects.

PostgreSQL now has a JSONB data type which we won't use here, but you should try out
someday.

```sql
INSERT INTO cards VALUES (1, 1, '{"name": "Paint house", "tags": ["Improvements", "Office"], "finished": true}');

SELECT data->>'name' AS name FROM cards
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE data ? 'ingredients';
```

We can also improve performance in large datasets by adding an index. Let's say we
are adding an index to students' names:

```sql
CREATE INDEX name_index ON students (full_name);
```

### Learnings

- Given SQL experience, basic to intermediate SQL knowledge
- Reminder of how a common SQL JOIN would work (trains and train reviews)
- New functions and concepts (ST_AsGeoJSON, (even spatial JOIN?)) for PostGIS
